This repository is organized by fracture diameter and flowrate. For example the folder "5kgs_1m" holds all necessary input and output files for the 5 kgs flowrate and 1m fracture diameter case. Another example would be "5kgs_1m_2fracs", this folder holds all the necessary input and output files for the 5 kg/s, 1m fracture diameter two fracture zone case. For more explanation on these cases please view the powerpoint under the "Powerpoint" folder.

The folder "z5kgs_1m_no_exit_perfs" holds all the input file for the 1m fracture diameter case where exit perforations and both perforations were turned off. The folder "z5kgs_2m_no_exit_perfs" holds all the input file for the 2m fracture diameter case where exit perforations and both perforations were turned off. 

Each folder also contains a Jupyter Notebook that will generate all the plots found in the "plots" folders. Each powerpoint slide with a plot on it has a list of each input and output file that was used in that case.
